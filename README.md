Secure Workstation Build & Hardened Infrastructure Project

## Project Overview
This project documents the end-to-end security hardening and deployment of a performance-optimized workstation. I transitioned from a performance-limited Celeron system to a security-optimized Ryzen environment specifically architected to support high-density virtualization for Identity & Access Management (IAM) and SOC (Security Operations Center) labs.

### Added Context & Scope
* **Host system resources:** 16GB DDR4 RAM, 6C/12T CPU
* **Active lab usage:** 3–5 concurrent virtual machines
* **Typical hypervisor utilization during SOC scenarios:** 65–85% CPU, ~12–14GB RAM in use
* **Purpose-built for:** Continuous SOC investigations, IAM testing, vulnerability analysis, and CTF simulations

### Measured Performance Outcome
* **VM boot times:** Reduced by approximately 60–70%
* **Lab stability:** Improved from intermittent crashes to 24/7 sustained operation
* **Capacity:** Increased from 1–2 limited VMs to 3–5 stable VMs simultaneously
